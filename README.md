# sandbox-docker
Experimental repository for Docker integration

## Objective
The objective of this repository is to test the GitHub-Docker integration for automated builds. It doesn't really serve any other purpose and might be deleted in the future. The container created by this repository does not contain anything of use. The *Dockerfile* will help evaluate different ways and methods to create a docker container automatically.

## Focus
The experiment will focus on the following aspects:

* Triggering automated Docker builds
* Build tagged versions of GitHub tags
* Docker's automatic ingestion of documentation provided via README.md in GitHub
* Availability of automated containers in the docker registry
